Scratch Arch


This project is about bringing a linux distro known as "Arch Linux" to scratch as close as possible.
Currently there is a infant gui, but we are working on making it full

This version uses the KDE Plasma desktop environment. this does not use the GNOME desktop, like the main branch.

Pacman is also being worked on

Go to the releases section to download it early, or go to the scratch page: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/673703556/

All rights go to the Arch linux team, Grub team, and Linux devs
